          The History of Orthopaedics in Bangalore dates back to 1956, when Dr. H K Srinivas Murthy established the Department of Orthopaedics in Victoria Hospital attached to Bangalore Medical College. Later by 1960-64, others joined as lecturers after post-graduate qualification mostly from AIIMS, New Delhi and K.G. Medical College Lucknow. By 1980, a few private Orthopaedic surgeons opened their practices and were practicing Orthopaedic surgery in various hospitals, like St. Marthaâ€™s and St. Philomena Hospital.

          Taking cue from clinical proceedings of Bombay Orthopaedic Society, a few of them, led by Dr. V Hanumanthaiah, met at a medical association lecture hall over a cup of tea and discussed the formation of Bangalore Orthopaedic Society in 1986. The BOS was ultimately formed with Dr. V Hanumanthaiah as one of its pioneers.
